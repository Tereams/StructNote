# StructNote

StructNote is a lightweight Python Tkinter application that combines the flexibility of plain text with the organization of structured data.  
It is designed for users who find plain notepads too unstructured for long notes, and CSV/JSON too rigid for creative writing.  

## Motivation
Traditional notepads lack structure, while CSV/JSON editing forces users to handle raw data instead of focusing on the content.  
StructNote bridges this gap by offering **structured organization + smooth writing experience** in one tool.

## Features
- **Two views for structure**:
  - **Table mode**: manage data in a grid (CSV format).
  - **Tree mode**: organize notes hierarchically (JSON or XML format).
- **Rich text editor**: focus on writing detailed content on the right panel.
- **Seamless integration**: left side for structure, right side for content.

## Roadmap
- Initial version: built with **Tkinter** (simple and lightweight).
- Future upgrades: migrate to a more efficient framework such as **PyQt** or a **web-based frontend (React/Angular + FastAPI)**.
